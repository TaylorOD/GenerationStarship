## Generation Starship

I've wanted to make a idle clicker game for a while. This is my attempt at modding/morphing Universal Paperclips into Generation Starship.

You are an AI tasked with leading a generation starship migration to a new planet.

Mission Objectives:

 1. Keep Human Crew and Passengers Alive
 2. Locate Habitable Planet for Human Colonization.
 3. Prepare for Long-Term Autonomous Operation - Expand AI Core Capabilities
 4. DO NOT HARD HUMAN CREW OR PASSENGERS
